MarkdownLinkCheck
=================

This is a simple PowerShell module to check links correctness in your markdown files.
It supports both absolute and relative links.
The primary scenario that it targets is verifing markdown docs hosted on GitHub.

The heavy lifting of parsing markdown is done by [markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig).

This is a very early work.
Markdig.dll committed directly to this repo to make build process simpler.
It should be done more elegantly in the future.
